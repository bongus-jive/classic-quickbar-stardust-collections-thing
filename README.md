replaces the collections button with the Stardust quickbar
so theres a button for Classic QB and another one for StardustQB
collections can still be opened from inside quickbar

i have no real idea why this mod exists or why you would want it
its literally just two quickbars?? and one has less features? this accomplishes nothing
it's just how ive had it set up for like 3 years now. but you can have it! if you really want it!

requires [Classic Quickbar](https://github.com/bongus-jive/classic-quickbar/) with [StardustCore](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite)
